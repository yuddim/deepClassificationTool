# deepClassificationTool 
Deep Classification Tool based on Keras. Tool implements light versions of VGG, ResNet and InceptionV3 for small images.
Tool uses python 3.5

deepClassificationTool.py - main module for training and testing of deep neural network

testFunctions.py - functions for testing of trained deep neural network on one image, two images and folder of images

modelVGGm.py - Light version of VGG for small images - Inspired from VGG, 2014 - VGGm(modified)

modelResNetM.py - Light version of ResNet for small images - resNetM (modified)
